# Morphia Demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xeraa/morphia-demo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xeraa/morphia-demo)

This is a simple test project I use to show some Morphia features.


## Requirements

*   JDK 7+
*   Gradle

You can either use a standalone MongoDB server and if that is not available on the default port 27017,
the test code will start an embedded MongoDB process.


## Getting started

Inside the base folder (where the ``build.gradle`` file is located) run the following command to get started:

    gradle test
